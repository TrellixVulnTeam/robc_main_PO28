	It works like this:<br><br>
		1.) Put a <?=SITE_NAME?> widget on your webpage<br>
		2.) We gather data about your best pages<br>
		3.) We send you between <b><?=$percentage?>-700%</b> of the traffic you send (we have a few websites well above 700%)<br><br>
	As a bonus the most popular post gets put on the front page every hour! That is a ton of <b>extra free traffic</b>.<br><br>

        <b>The Blog Riser Algoritm</b><br><br>
		The "blog riser" algorithm looks at the top pages of a website over the past 48-72 hours, and sends the majority of traffic to them.  No need for you to submit anything, or do any work.  We do it all for you.  Additionally, it gets your more recent posts.  Not ones that you did 3 months ago.

        <br><br>
		<b>Hosting</b><br><br>
			As you can imagine some powerful servers are needed to run <?=SITE_NAME?>.  We have to plug <a style="color:blue" href="http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=106084&u=280858&m=15362&urllink=&afftrack=">The Planet</a> for their cheap hosting and Centrility for their assistance in scaling the backend of the site. If you need some scaling help, send them an email here: <script language=javascript>piece_together("cen", "trility@gm", "ail.com")</script>
