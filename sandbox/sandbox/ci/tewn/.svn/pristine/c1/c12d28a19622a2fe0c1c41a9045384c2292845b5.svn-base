	<h2>What is it?</h2><br>
	 Users coming to your Crowd Ignited landing page are finicky.  They respond well to some layouts and not-so-well to others.  This system helps figure out what layout your users respond to the best, and then shows that layout more often to get you the maximum number of outgoing clicks as possible.
<br><br>
	<h2>How Does it Work?</h2><br>
	 Crowd Ignite tracks how many times a style of a landing page is loaded, and then looks at how many clicks are generated by that landing page style.  Does some basic math (number of clicks / number of times loaded) to figure out what landing page style is the best.  It will then show the style which does better more often.
<br><br>
	<h2>How Do I get it on my Hub?</h2><br>
	 Just 3 things are needed:
	<blockquote>
	1.) Create a new layout of landing page (ex. a grid of the pictures, or a list them in rows, or a hybrid)<br><br>
	2.) Enable your landing page code handle the different styles<br><br>
	3.) Create a new <a href="/analytics/landing_page">landing page varient on Crowd Ignite</a>
	</blockquote>
