What is this?
=============
Wrappers and convenience fuctions for working with the javascriptRRD, Flot and
Collectd.


Debian / Ubuntu Quick Start
===========================
To get this demo working, you will need to serve this page from a
local webserver and serve the folder that contains your RRD files.

This demo is designed to work with the RRD files generated by
<a href="http://collectd.org/">Collectd</a>.

# Install and configure collectd (enable the rrd plugin)
$ aptitude install collectd

# Create a project folder and check out the code
$ mkdir -p ~/Projects/Jarmon
$ cd ~/Projects/Jarmon
$ bzr branch lp:~richardw/jarmon/trunk
$ cd trunk

# Link to the collectd rrd folder
$ ln -s /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost data

# Start a local webserver - here we use Twisted, but there are other web server
# config examples in docs/
$ aptitude install twisted
$ twistd -n web --port 8080 --path .
