# POST-COMMIT HOOK
#
# The post-commit hook is invoked after a commit.  Subversion runs
# this hook by invoking a program (script, executable, binary, etc.)
# named 'post-commit' (for which this file is a template) with the 
# following ordered arguments:
#
#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#   [2] REV          (the number of the revision just committed)



REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"
REPONAME="`basename ${REPOS%% r*}`"

/ops/repo/scripts/commit-email.pl "$REPOS" "$REV" <%= contacts %> --from diff@bot.gnmedia.net -s "[$REPONAME]"
