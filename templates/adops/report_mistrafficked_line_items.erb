The following entries reflect parent line items that have no impressions, but
their children do. Please review these entries and check to see if they have
been set up as intended.

1. If the parent line item in question should be trafficked / delivering please
check AdOps and DFP to make sure it's set up correctly.

2. If the parent really is just a placeholder and does not need to run somewhere,
please open a ticket via QT in the AdOps queue and we'll manually fix the issue.

3. If the entry is simply missing a DFP id, please make sure to open a ticket
via QT in the AdOps queue and we can manually sync the id.

NOTE: If you have already 'fixed' the line items and their campaigns but the
the entry is still listed in this email, it is probably related to issue #2.
Please open a ticket with AdOps and let us know.

It appears that the cron job, "${job}" DID NOT complete successfully.
Please verify the following:

1. Log into the cron host, ${cronhost}, and verify that the job named
"${job}", has completed running.

2. If the previous job completed running, log into ${dbhost} 
and check the output of the command: 
    "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G"
    - Verify that the value of "Seconds_Behind_Master" is "0"

3. If ${dbhost} is not behind the master,
(i.e. Seconds_Behind_Master==0), contact the rest of the Ad Platform team:
    adplatform@evolvemediallc.com
